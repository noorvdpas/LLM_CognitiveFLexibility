Kingsley_Halt_railway_station,clean,"Kingsley Halt was a railway station on the Bordon Light Railway which served the village of Kingsley, Hampshire, England. The station had been constructed by the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) in the hope that the area would attract residential development, but this did not happen. The LSWR had purchased an area of land far larger than that what was actually used, as they hoped to construct a large station and goods yard. A primitive halt with a single platform opened some months after the line's opening, consisting merely of a nameboard, noticeboard, lamp and seat. Declining passenger traffic and reduced military activities at Bordon after the Second World War saw the line's closure to regular services in 1957. Kingsley Halt was demolished soon after closure, and nothing now remains except the shape of the trackbed, now used as a farm track."

Astar_(game),clean,"Astar is a two-player abstract strategy board game from Kyrgyzstan. It is a game similar to draughts and Alquerque as players hop over one another's pieces when capturing.

The board somewhat resembles those of kotu ellima, sixteen soldiers, and peralikatuma, all of which are games related to astar.

Epinotia_nemorivaga,clean,"Epinotia nemorivaga, the bearberry bell, is a species of moth in the family Tortricidae. It is found in Europe (from Fennoscandia and northern Russia to the Iberian Peninsula and Italy, and from Ireland to Poland) and Asia (China: Henan, Sichuan, Guizhou, Shaanxi). The wingspan is 10–12 mm. The face and palpi are pale brownish. The forewings are silvery- whitish, finely strigulated with fuscous. The costa is posteriorly strigulated with dark fuscous and white. There are some scattered dark fuscous strigulae. The basal patch with edge somewhat bent, the central fascia with posterior median projection, and an irregular spot touching termen in middle are all dark fuscous. The termen is hardly sinuate. The cilia have a white subapical dash. The hindwings are grey. The larva is pale yellowish; head dark brown. Adults are on wing in June and July in western Europe. The larvae feed on Arctostaphylos alpinus and Arctostaphylos uva-ursi. The larvae mine the leaves of their host plant. They can be found from September to May."

Legal_separation,clean,"Legal separation (sometimes judicial separation, separate maintenance, divorce a mensa et thoro, or divorce from bed-and-board) is a legal process by which a married couple may formalize a marital separation while remaining legally married. A legal separation is granted in the form of a court order. In cases where children are involved, a court order of legal separation often makes child custody arrangements, specifying sole custody or shared parenting, as well as child support. Some couples obtain a legal separation as an alternative to a divorce, based on moral or religious objections to divorce. Legal separation does not automatically lead to divorce. The couple might reconcile, in which case they do not have to do anything in order to continue their marriage"

Neutral_lipid_storage_disease,clean,"Neutral lipid storage disease (also known as Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome) is a congenital autosomal recessive disorder characterized by accumulation of triglycerides in the cytoplasm of leukocytes (Jordans' anomaly), muscle, liver, fibroblasts, and other tissues.
